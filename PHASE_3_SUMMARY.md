## Architecture Details

### **Network Protocol**

#### Message Types
```gdscript
enum MessageType {
    PING,                    # Heartbeat
    PONG,                    # Heartbeat response
    CREATE_LOBBY,            # Request lobby creation
    LOBBY_CREATED,           # Lobby creation success
    JOIN_LOBBY,              # Request to join lobby
    LOBBY_JOINED,            # Join success
    LEAVE_LOBBY,             # Player leaving
    PLAYER_READY,            # Player ready status
    SUBMIT_TEAM,             # Team submission
    TEAM_VALIDATED,          # Team validation result
    BATTLE_START,            # Battle initialization
    SUBMIT_ACTION,           # Battle action
    BATTLE_STATE,            # State synchronization
    BATTLE_EVENT,            # Battle events (damage, faint, etc.)
    BATTLE_END,              # Battle conclusion
    ERROR                    # Error messages
}
```

#### Error Codes
```gdscript
enum ErrorCode {
    INVALID_PACKET,          # Malformed packet
    VERSION_MISMATCH,        # Protocol version incompatible
    LOBBY_NOT_FOUND,         # Invalid lobby ID
    LOBBY_FULL,              # Lobby at capacity
    INVALID_TEAM,            # Team validation failed
    INVALID_ACTION,          # Action validation failed
    NOT_YOUR_TURN,           # Out of turn action
    BATTLE_NOT_STARTED,      # Battle not in progress
    INTERNAL_ERROR           # Server error
}
```

### **Security Validation**

#### Packet Validation
- Message type must be valid enum value (0-15)
- Timestamp must be within acceptable range:
  - Not in future (allowing 5s clock skew)
  - Not too old (max 5 minutes)
- Protocol version must match (currently v1.0.0)
- Data field must be present Dictionary

#### Team Validation
- Team size: 1-6 Pokemon
- Each Pokemon:
  - Level: 1-100
  - Moves: 1-4 valid move IDs
  - Species ID must exist in DataManager
  - Ability must be valid for species
  - Item must be valid (if present)
  - EVs: Total ≤ 510, each stat ≤ 252
  - IVs: Each stat 0-31

#### Action Validation
- Action type must be valid (MOVE, SWITCH, FORFEIT)
- Move actions: index 0-3
- Switch actions: index 0-5
- Target validation based on game state
- No duplicate submissions per turn
- Player must own the Pokemon

#### String Sanitization
- Remove control characters (char codes < 32)
- Truncate to maximum length (default 100 chars)
- Remove newlines and carriage returns
- Prevent injection attacks
