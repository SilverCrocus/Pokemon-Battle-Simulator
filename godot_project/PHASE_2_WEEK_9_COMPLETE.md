# Phase 2 Week 9: AI, Results & Audio - COMPLETE ✅

**Duration**: Week 9 (1 week)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## Overview

Week 9 delivered three major systems that complete the single-player experience:
1. **AI Opponent System** - Computer-controlled opponents with difficulty levels
2. **Battle Results Screen** - Post-battle summary with navigation
3. **Audio System** - Comprehensive sound effects and music infrastructure

---

## Completed Features

### ✅ AI Opponent System (scripts/core/BattleAI.gd - ~240 lines)

**Difficulty Levels:**
- **RANDOM** - Completely random move selection
- **BASIC** - Type-effectiveness aware (prefers super-effective moves)
- **INTERMEDIATE** - Placeholder for future damage calculation AI

**Decision Logic:**
```gdscript
func decide_action() -> BattleAction:
    if pokemon_fainted:
        return decide_switch()

    match difficulty:
        RANDOM: return random_move()
        BASIC: return best_type_matchup_move()
        INTERMEDIATE: return damage_optimized_move()
```

**Type Effectiveness Calculation:**
- Calculates effectiveness against both opponent types
- Multiplies type1 and type2 effectiveness
- Categories: Super-effective (≥2.0x), Neutral (>0.5x), Not very effective (≤0.5x)

**Integration:**
- Integrated into BattleController
- AI plays as team 2 (opponent side)
- Seamless action submission with player actions

---

### ✅ Battle Results Screen

**Components Created:**
- **BattleResultsScreen.gd** (~200 lines) - Results display logic
- **BattleResultsScreen.tscn** - Full-screen overlay scene

**Features:**
- **Victory/Defeat Display**
  - Green "VICTORY!" for player wins
  - Red "DEFEAT" for player losses
  - Subtitle message

### ✅ Audio System

**AudioManager Autoload (autoloads/AudioManager.gd - ~370 lines)**

**Architecture:**
```
AudioManager (Autoload)
├── MusicPlayer (1 AudioStreamPlayer)
│   └── Bus: Music
└── SFXPlayers (8 AudioStreamPlayer pool)
    └── Bus: SFX
```

**Music System:**
- Play/stop with fade transitions
- Pause/resume support
- Loop configuration
- Duplicate detection (won't restart if already playing)

**Sound Effects System:**
- 8 concurrent sound effect support
- Automatic player allocation
- Volume scaling per-sound
- Busy player detection

**Volume Control:**
- Master volume (0.0-1.0)
- Music volume (0.0-1.0)
- SFX volume (0.0-1.0)
- Linear-to-dB conversion
- Bus-based control via AudioServer

**Audio Bus Layout (default_bus_layout.tres):**
```
Master (0.0 dB)
├── Music (0.0 dB)
└── SFX (0.0 dB)
```

**UI Integration Points (11 hooks):**
1. Main menu music (on ready)
2. Button clicks (5 menu buttons)
3. Battle music (on battle start)
4. Victory/defeat music (on battle end)
5. Move sound effects (by category)
6. Pokemon faint sound
7. Results screen buttons (2 buttons)

**Audio Hooks Ready (Commented Out):**
All audio calls are prepared but commented out with:
```gdscript
# TODO: Uncomment when audio files are added
# AudioManager.play_music("battle", true, true)
```

**Expected Audio File Structure:**
```
res://audio/
├── music/
│   ├── main_menu.ogg
│   ├── battle.ogg
│   ├── victory.ogg
│   └── defeat.ogg
└── sfx/
    ├── button_press.wav
    ├── move_physical.wav
    ├── move_special.wav
    ├── move_status.wav
    └── pokemon_faint.wav
```
