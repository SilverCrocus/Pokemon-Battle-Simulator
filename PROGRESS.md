## Decision Log

### Recent Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-10-02 | Ship with legacy effect system (Option 1) | Godot class loading limitation prevents new framework integration. Legacy system fully functional. | MEDIUM - No impact on launch, framework preserved |
| 2025-10-02 | Disable MoveEffectRegistry autoload | Cannot resolve base class during autoload initialization | LOW - Legacy system handles all effects |
| 2025-10-01 | Complete Phase 3 before Phase 4 | Network multiplayer is core feature | HIGH - Ensures multiplayer works |

### Historical Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-10-01 | Use Godot 4 instead of Unity | Better 2D workflow, free, built-in networking | HIGH - Sets entire tech stack |
| 2025-10-01 | Use GDScript instead of C# | Better Godot integration, easier for turn-based | MEDIUM - Language choice |
| 2025-10-01 | Use .tres files instead of JSON/SQLite | Type-safe, cached by engine, better performance | MEDIUM - Data architecture |
| 2025-10-01 | Server-authoritative from day one | Prevents cheating, easier than refactoring later | HIGH - Architecture |
| 2025-10-01 | Event-driven architecture (BattleEvents) | Decouples engine from UI, enables replay | HIGH - Architecture |
| 2025-10-01 | Seeded RNG for determinism | Enables battle replay and debugging | MEDIUM - Testing |
