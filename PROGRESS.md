## Decision Log

### Key Decisions Made

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-10-01 | Use Godot 4 instead of Unity | Better 2D workflow, free, built-in networking | HIGH - Sets entire tech stack |
| 2025-10-01 | Use GDScript instead of C# | Better Godot integration, easier for turn-based | MEDIUM - Language choice |
| 2025-10-01 | Use .tres files instead of JSON/SQLite | Type-safe, cached by engine, better performance | MEDIUM - Data architecture |
| 2025-10-01 | Focus on Gen 9 OU only initially | Manageable scope, can expand later | HIGH - Feature scope |
| 2025-10-01 | Server-authoritative from day one | Prevents cheating, easier than refactoring later | HIGH - Architecture |
| 2025-10-01 | Use uv instead of pip/requirements.txt | Cleaner Python environment management | LOW - Tooling choice |
